Data structures and algorithms in C

I want to refresh what I learnt about data structures and algorithms several years ago. I thought that the best way to do that would be write basic data structures and 
algorithms in a low-level language like C. There is a great joy in writing C programs. I may not use C in a professional setting but I will sharpen my skills if I write 
a lot of C programs.
