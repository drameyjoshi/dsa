[1] Use ANTLR4 tool to generate the Java files.
    antlr4 SqlBaseLexer.g4 SqlBaseParser.g4 

[2] Compile the Java files.
    javac *.java

[3] Run the grun tool as:
    grun SqlBase singleStatement -gui

    Enter the query - select uuid, age from gold.user;
   

Ideas for pretty printing
-------------------------
Walk the parse tree and keep track of the level. The first SELECT clause
will have zero indent. Increase the indent by 1 each time you get to a 
terminal at the next lower level.
